# ProgrammingParadigms Java, JavaScript, and Python
Assignments from Programming Paradigm Class at University of Arkansas during the fall semester of my sophomore year. The assignments were iterative sprints (Agile Methodology) building upon the same mario game project. The later assignments are the finished game. Implemented the game in Java first, then JavaScript, and lastly Python. Learned the MVC model for the development of these games.
